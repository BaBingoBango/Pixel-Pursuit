## Quick Start
This game is designed for iPad! To play, download and run the Xcode project on an iPad connected to your Mac!

> **Warning**<br>
> Standard gameplay is not compatible with the Xcode Simulator, since the app relies on the augmented reality interaction. Please be sure to build and run the app on a physical device.
